Ready to test your combat skills? The Arena is where you can engage in **Player vs. Player (PvP)** combat without any risk to your items in the normal survival world. It's the perfect place to practice your fighting skills and have some fun.

### How to Enter the Arena:

Use the command `/warp arena` to teleport directly to the PvP zone.

### Supply Crates:

To make things more interesting, a new batch of **Supply Crates** will spawn in the arena every hour. These crates are filled with valuable loot, but you'll have to be quick and fight off other players to get to them first!
