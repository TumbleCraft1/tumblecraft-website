Daily Quests are a special set of tasks that reset every single day. They are one of the most efficient and rewarding ways to gain **Level XP** on the server.

### How Daily Quests Work:

*   Use the `/quests` command to see your available daily quests.
*   Complete the objectives, which could be anything from mining certain blocks to catching fish.
*   Once completed, you'll receive a large amount of Level XP!

Making a habit of completing your daily quests is the fastest way to level up and unlock new perks!
