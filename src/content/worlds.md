Our server features several distinct worlds for you to explore, build, and conquer. You can travel between them using the `/worlds` command.

### Our Worlds:

*   **Survival World (30k x 30k)**
    This is the main world where you will build your base, team up with friends, and live your survival adventure. Its massive size means there's plenty of room for everyone!

*   **Nether World (10k x 10k)**
    The classic realm of fire and danger. Travel here to gather Nether-specific resources, but be prepared for a fight.

*   **End World (5k x 5k)**
    Home of the Ender Dragon. Venture here to challenge the boss, find Elytras, and explore End Cities.

*   **Mining World (5k x 5k)**
    This world is specifically for gathering resources! It resets on a regular schedule, so it's always full of fresh ores and materials. Using the Mining World helps keep our main Survival World beautiful and unspoiled.
