The shop is the most straightforward way to make money on the server. By selling the items you gather, you can build a steady income to fund all your projects.

### How to Use the Shop:

Simply use the `/shop` command to open the shop menu. From there, you can browse different categories and see the current prices for all sellable items.

### What Sells Best?

While many items can be sold, focusing on these resources is a great strategy for making money:

*   **Farming Resources**: Crops like wheat, carrots, potatoes, and sugarcane are always in demand.
*   **Mining Resources**: Ores like iron, gold, and diamonds, as well as other materials like cobblestone, are great sellers.
