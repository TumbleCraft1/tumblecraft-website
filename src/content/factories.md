Factories introduce a whole new way to get materials on the server. Instead of gathering everything by hand, you can invest in factories that will produce certain materials for you automatically over time.

### How Factories Work:

Use the factories menu to browse the different types of factories you can build. Each factory requires an initial investment of money and resources, but once it's running, it will generate valuable items for you to collect.

This is an advanced feature that is perfect for players who want to dive deep into our server's economy.
