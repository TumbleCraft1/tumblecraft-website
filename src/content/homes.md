Homes are one of the most useful commands on the server. A home is a personal teleport point that you can set anywhere you like, allowing you to return to that exact spot instantly.

### How to Use Homes:

*   `/sethome <name>` ➜ Creates a home with a specific name at your current location.
*   `/home <name>` ➜ Teleports you to the home you specified.
*   `/delhome <name>` ➜ Deletes a home.

### Home Limits:

By default, all players can set **2 homes**. You can unlock the ability to set more homes by **leveling up** on the server or by purchasing a donator rank.
