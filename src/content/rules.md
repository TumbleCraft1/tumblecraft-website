To make sure our server is a fun, safe, and fair place for everyone, we have a set of rules that all players are expected to follow. Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.

Our rules are based on common sense, but here are the key points:

1.  **Be Respectful**: No harassment, hate speech, or excessive toxicity towards any player.
2.  **No Cheating or Hacking**: Using any kind of hacked client, x-ray, or exploits is strictly forbidden.
3.  **No Griefing or Stealing**: Do not destroy or steal from another player's claimed land.
4.  **No Spamming or Advertising**: Do not spam the chat or advertise other servers.

For a full, detailed list of the rules, please visit the rules board at spawn.
