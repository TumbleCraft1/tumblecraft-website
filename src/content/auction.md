The Auction House is where you can trade with other players. It's the best place to find rare items that you can't buy in the regular shop, or to sell your own unique treasures for a great price.

### How to Use the Auction House:

*   **To View Auctions**: Simply use the command `/ah` or `/auction` to open the menu and browse what other players are selling.
*   **To Sell an Item**: Hold the item you want to sell in your hand and use the command:
    `/auction sell <price>`

This is the safest way to trade with other players, as the server handles the transaction for you.
