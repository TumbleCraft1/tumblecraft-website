Crates are a fun way to get your hands on some of the best items on the server. Each crate requires a **key** to open, and each key corresponds to a different type of crate with different potential loot.

### How to Open Crates:

1.  Get a Crate Key by voting, from rewards, or from the server store.
2.  Go to the **Crate Area** at `/warp crates`.
3.  Right-click the crate that matches your key.
4.  Watch the roll and see what amazing prize you've won!

### Available Crates:

We have several tiers of crates, each better than the last:

*   **Vote Crate**
*   **Common Crate**
*   **Rare Crate**
*   **Epic Crate**
*   **Superior Crate**
