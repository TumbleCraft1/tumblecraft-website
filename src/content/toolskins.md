Tired of your diamond sword looking the same as everyone else's? With ToolSkins, you can apply a new, custom look to your favorite tools and weapons.

### How ToolSkins Work:

1.  **Obtain a Skin**: You can get ToolSkins from the `/coinshop`, from Crates, or as a reward for leveling up.
2.  **Apply the Skin**: Use the ToolSkins menu to apply a skin to an item in your inventory.

This is a purely cosmetic change, so you can look cool without affecting the stats of your tools. Mix and match to create the perfect look!
