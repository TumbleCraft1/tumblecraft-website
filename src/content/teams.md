Why play alone when you can team up? Our server allows you to create and join teams to collaborate with other players.

### How to Use Teams:

*   `/team create <name>` ➜ Create a new team.
*   `/team invite <player>` ➜ Invite a player to your team.
*   `/team join <team>` ➜ Join a team you've been invited to.
*   `/team leave` ➜ Leave your current team.

### Team Perks:

Being on a team gives you access to great features:

*   **Team Chat**: A private chat channel only for your team members.
*   **Team Homes**: Shared `/sethome` locations that all team members can teleport to.
*   **Team Balance**: A shared bank account for the team.
*   **Team Ranks & Upgrades**: Promote members within your team and unlock team-wide upgrades.
