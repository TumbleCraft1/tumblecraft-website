Kits are a quick way to get a full set of gear and items. They are on a cooldown, so you can claim them periodically to restock.

### How to Use Kits:

Use the `/kits` command to see all the kits available to you. From there, you can claim any kit that isn't on cooldown.

### Types of Kits:

*   **Starter Kits**: These kits are available to all players and provide essential items to help you get started, like basic tools, food, and armor.
*   **Ranked Kits**: These are exclusive, more powerful kits that are only available to players who have purchased a donator rank. The higher the rank, the better the kit!
