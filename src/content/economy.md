Money is a central part of our server, allowing you to buy, sell, and trade with other players. A healthy bank balance will open up many new opportunities for you!

### How to Earn Money:

There are many ways to build your fortune:

*   **`/shop`**: The most reliable way to make money. Sell the resources you gather, like crops, ores, and wood, for instant cash.
*   **`/jobs`**: Join a job to get paid for doing the things you already do, like mining, fishing, or building.
*   **`/auction`**: Sell rare and valuable items directly to other players in the auction house.
*   **Leveling Up**: You get a cash reward every time you level up!

### How to Spend Money:

Once you have money, you can use it for:

*   **Buying from players**: Purchase items from the `/auction` or trade directly with others.
*   **`/lottery`**: Feeling lucky? Buy a lottery ticket for a chance to win the grand prize!
*   **Factories**: Invest in factories to produce valuable materials automatically.
