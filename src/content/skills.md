Beyond your main player level, you can also train a variety of **skills**. This system rewards you for specializing in certain tasks. The more you practice a skill, the higher its level will become, unlocking special abilities and perks along the way.

### How Skills Work:

When you perform certain actions, you gain skill XP. For example:

*   **Mining**: Breaking ores and stone levels up your Mining skill.
*   **Farming**: Harvesting crops improves your Farming skill.
*   **Running**: Simply moving around the world will increase your Running skill over time.

As your skills level up, you might unlock passive boosts, special abilities, or other cool perks related to that skill!
