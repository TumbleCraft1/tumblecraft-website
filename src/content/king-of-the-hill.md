**King Of The Hill (KOTH)** is an automated event where players battle to capture and hold a specific area in the arena. It's a true test of strength and strategy.

### How KOTH Works:

1.  An announcement will be made in chat when a KOTH event is about to begin.
2.  Head to the designated KOTH area at `/warp arena`.
3.  Stand in the capture zone to start capturing it. Be prepared to fight off other players who want to claim it for themselves!
4.  The player who holds the point for the required amount of time wins the event and receives amazing rewards!
