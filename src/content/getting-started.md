### Welcome to the Server!

We're so excited to have you join our community! Your epic survival adventure starts now. Follow these simple steps to get going:

1.  **Teleport to the Survival World**
    To begin, you'll want to head to our main survival world. You can get to a random spot in the wild by using the command `/rtp`. This will ensure you have plenty of space to yourself.

2.  **Gather Resources & Build Your Base**
    Just like classic survival, you'll need to gather resources like wood, stone, and food. Once you've found the perfect spot, you can start building your first home!

3.  **Claim Your Land**
    To protect your creations, you must **claim your land**. This prevents other players from building or breaking blocks in your area. Check out our `Claiming` guide for a simple walkthrough on how to do this.

### Get a Head Start!

To help you on your journey, we offer some free rewards:
- Use the `/rewards` command to get free items every hour, day, and week!
- Don't forget to use your free **Crate Keys** at `/warp crates`. You might get something amazing!
