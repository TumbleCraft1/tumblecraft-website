Coins are a premium currency that unlock a whole new range of cool items and perks. While regular money is for survival needs, Coins are for showing off your style!

### How to Get Coins:

Coins are more valuable and harder to get than money. You can earn them by:

*   **Leveling Up**: You'll receive Coins as a reward for reaching new levels.
*   **`/rewards`**: Claim your daily and weekly rewards for a chance at some Coins.
*   **`/afk`**: Hang out at our AFK Pond to earn Coins while you're away.
*   **Server Store**: You can also purchase Coins from our webstore to support the server.

### The Coinshop

Use the `/coinshop` command to browse all the exclusive items you can buy with your Coins, including **Cosmetics**, **ToolSkins**, and more!
