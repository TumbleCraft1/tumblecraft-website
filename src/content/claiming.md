### Protect Your Hard Work!

Found the perfect spot for your base? Great! The next step is to **claim the land** to protect it. Claiming an area prevents other players from placing or breaking blocks, opening your chests, or using your items. It's your own private space!

### How To Claim Land:

Claiming is easy and uses a **Golden Shovel**.

1.  Get a Golden Shovel (you can craft one or use one from a kit).
2.  Go to one corner of the area you want to claim and **right-click a block** with the Golden Shovel.
3.  Walk to the opposite corner of the area.
4.  **Right-click another block** there. Your claim is now created!

You can see your claimed areas and how many claim blocks you have left by holding your shovel. You get more claim blocks automatically just by playing on the server!
