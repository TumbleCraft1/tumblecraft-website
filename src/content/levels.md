Levels are a core part of your progression on the server. Nearly everything you do, from mining and building to fighting monsters, will earn you **Level XP**. As you gain XP, you will level up!

### How Leveling Works:

*   **Gain XP**: You get Level XP automatically just by being online and playing.
*   **Level Up**: When your XP bar is full, you'll advance to the next level.

### Perks of Leveling Up:

Each time you level up, you'll receive great rewards, such as:

*   **Money and Coins**
*   **More `/sethome` slots**
*   **Access to new commands and perks**

Leveling is our way of rewarding you for being an active member of our community!
