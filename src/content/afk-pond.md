We understand that sometimes you need to go AFK (Away From Keyboard). At our AFK Pond, you can do so while still earning some nice rewards for your time.

### How it Works:

Simply go to `/warp afk` and stand in the pond. That's it! As long as you remain in the pond, you'll accumulate rewards.

### Rewards:

*   **15 minutes** = 2 Coins
*   **1 hour** = 1 Common Crate Key

It's an easy way to earn some extra currency and keys while you're busy.
