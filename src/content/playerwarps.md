Player Warps allow you to set up your own public teleport point that any other player on the server can use. This is perfect for creating player-run shops, public farms, or just showing off a cool build.

### How to Create a Player Warp:

1.  Stand in the exact spot where you want players to arrive.
2.  Use the command `/pw set <name>`.

That's it! Your warp is now active and will appear in the Player Warps menu for everyone to see. You can manage your warps with other `/pw` commands.
